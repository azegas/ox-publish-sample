Debugging this issue - https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/369

# Replicate the issue

Sample configuration taken from here - https://orgmode.org/manual/Simple-example.html

1. Clone this repository to /tmp or anywhere else on your system
2. Check =html= folder, notice that it is empty
3. Check =org= folder, notice there are 3 .org files in it that were created
   with Denote
4. Only one file =20240606T072955--file__emacs.org= has a link in it. A regular
   emacs link.
5. Turn on =*Messages*= buffer alongside
6. Go to the configuration - =build/build-site.el= and evaluate both code blocks
7. Finally generate html files by =M-x my-org-publish-org-force=
8. Check =html= folder once again, you will see 3 html files exported
9. Now go back to =20240606T072955--file__emacs.org= file and add a Denote link
   to =best file= by pressing =C-c n i=
10. Now inside of the =20240606T072955--file__emacs.org= we have two links to
    =20240606T073028--best-file__economics.org=. One regular Emacs link and one
    Denote link
11. Delete the files in =html= folder
12. Try to generate html files again by =M-x my-org-publish-org-force=
13. Notice =denote-link-ol-export: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil= message
    in =*Messages*= buffer
