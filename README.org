Debugging this issue - https://github.com/protesilaos/denote/issues/369

# Replicate the issue

Sample configuration taken from here - https://orgmode.org/manual/Simple-example.html

1. Clone this repository to =/tmp= or anywhere else on your system
2. Create an empty =html= folder in the root directory (alongside =README.org=)
3. Check =org= folder, notice there are 3 =.org= files in it that were created
   with Denote
4. Only one file =20240606T072955--file__emacs.org= has a link in it. A regular
   emacs link.
5. Turn on =*Messages*= buffer alongside for debugging purposes
6. Go to the =ox-publish= configuration file - =build/build-site.el= and
   evaluate both code blocks inside of it
7. Finally generate =.html= files from =.org= files by =M-x
   my-org-publish-org-force=
8. Check =html= folder once again, you will see 3 =html= files exported
9. Now go back to =20240606T072955--file__emacs.org= file and add a Denote link
   to =best file= by pressing =C-c n i=
10. Now inside of the =20240606T072955--file__emacs.org= we have two links to
    =20240606T073028--best-file__economics.org=. One regular Emacs link and one
    Denote link
11. Delete the files in =html= folder, don't delete the folder itself
12. Try to generate =html= files again by =M-x my-org-publish-org-force=
13. Notice =denote-link-ol-export: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil= message
    in =*Messages*= buffer, the export did not succeed because of it
